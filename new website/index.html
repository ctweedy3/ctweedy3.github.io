    <h2>Berserk</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Berserk didn't start out as what it is today.  Berserk: The Prototype serves as the basis for the current Berserk but is wildly different from its successor. Guts differs from his current self as he is seen wearing an eye-patch and bears the symbol that later becomes the Brand of Sacrifice upon his chest instead of the back of his neck, similar to where Casca's mark is. The Prototype Guts also has a different reason for revenge: he witnessed apostles brutally kill his own mother.</li>
      <li class="list">Berserk has influenced a wide variety of media: making the loner with a big sword trope extremely popular. It is seen over and over again in mangas/animes like Bleach, Naruto, Ruroni Kenshin, Fairy Tail, Inuyasha, Shaman King, and many more. Games from the Dark Souls series were also heavily inspired by Berserk, with the primary example being Knight Artorias from Dark Souls.</li>
      <li class="list">Reddit user u/berserk_prime rook note of an interesting yet gruesome factoid: there are approximately 114 instances of eye-popping throughout Berserk from chapter 1 to chapter 347.  Volume 30 had the most instances, clocking in ata whopping 14.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Guts</h2>

    <ul>
       <li class="list">From the moment he was born, Guts' life was already pre-determined for agony. His mother was hanged in a tree moments before his birth and he was born in a pile of human guts, marinating there before some soldiers found him crying, hence the name.</li>
      <li class="list">Guts did, later on, find relative sanctuary in the mercenary group Band of the Hawk, led by the seemingly honorable Griffith. Too bad Griffith was never that honorable and put his ambition higher than anything else, including his friends.</li>
      <li class="list">As an added insult to injury. not only did Griffith took everything away from Guts and also violated what he held dear, but also essentially took over the entire human world. He pretty much became emperor of the false utopia he built.</li>
    </ul>
